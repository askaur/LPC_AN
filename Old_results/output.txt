Freezing the following nuisance parameters: RooArgSet:: = ()
The signal model has no nuisance parameters. Please run the limit tool with no systematics (option -S 0).
To make things easier, I will assume you have done it.
Computing limit starting from expected outcome
Set default minimizer to Minuit2, tolerance 0.01
Will compute both limit(s) using minimizer Minuit2 with strategy 0 and tolerance 0.01
